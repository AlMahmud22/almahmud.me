# WD_Test
This is a great setup for a full-stack web application project. Let's break it down folder by folder, explaining the purpose of each and how it connects to the website:

---

### **Root Folder: `C:\web\WD_Test`**
The root directory is the main entry point for your project. It contains general configuration files and documentation.

1. **`.env` and `.env.example`**
   - **Purpose**: `.env` is used to store sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, or environment-specific configurations. `.env.example` provides a template for others to know what keys they need to set.
   - **Involvement**: Environment variables affect both frontend (like API URLs) and backend (like database connections).

2. **`.eslintrc` and `.prettierrc`**
   - **Purpose**: Configurations for ESLint (code quality checker) and Prettier (code formatter). These ensure your code is clean and follows best practices.
   - **Involvement**: Both frontend and backend code formatting.

3. **`.gitignore`**
   - **Purpose**: Specifies which files and folders should not be tracked by Git (e.g., `node_modules`, `.env`).
   - **Involvement**: Prevents unnecessary files from being pushed to version control.

4. **`CONTRIBUTING.md`**
   - **Purpose**: Provides guidelines for contributing to the project.
   - **Involvement**: Useful for collaborative projects.

5. **`LICENSE`**
   - **Purpose**: Declares the legal terms under which your project can be used or modified.
   - **Involvement**: For open-source projects.

6. **`README.md`**
   - **Purpose**: Explains your project, how to set it up, and its purpose.
   - **Involvement**: A user or developer's first point of reference.

### **Frontend Folder: `client`**
This folder houses the **React** frontend of your application.

1. **`client/public`**
   - **Purpose**: Stores static files like `index.html`, images, and icons.
   - **Involvement**: The starting point for React. `index.html` is the template for your single-page application.

2. **`client/src`**
   - **Purpose**: Contains the main React application code.
   - **Involvement**: All user-facing parts of the website (pages, components, styles).

   - **`assets`**
     - **Purpose**: Stores static assets like images, fonts, or reusable media files.
     - **Involvement**: Anything visual, like logos or background images.

   - **`components`**
     - **Purpose**: Contains reusable React components like buttons, headers, or forms.
     - **Involvement**: Modular building blocks for your website.

   - **`context`**
     - **Purpose**: Manages global states using React Context API.
     - **Involvement**: Handles data like user authentication state or app-wide settings.

   - **`hooks`**
     - **Purpose**: Custom React hooks for reusable logic (e.g., fetching data or managing local storage).
     - **Involvement**: Simplifies complex logic and ensures clean code.

   - **`pages`**
     - **Purpose**: Contains individual pages of your website, like "Home," "Login," or "Dashboard."
     - **Involvement**: Represents full views rendered by the router.

   - **`styles`**
     - **Purpose**: Centralized CSS or SCSS files for styling the app.
     - **Involvement**: Handles the visual look and feel of the site.

   - **`utils`**
     - **Purpose**: Utility functions like date formatters or API handlers.
     - **Involvement**: General-purpose logic shared across components or pages.

   - **Core Files**
     - **`App.js`**: The main React component that sets up routes and renders pages.
     - **`index.js`**: The entry point of the React app, rendering `App.js`.
     - **`routes.js`**: Defines and organizes the app's routes.

---

### **Backend Folder: `server`**
This folder contains the **Node.js/Express** backend of your application.

1. **`server/config`**
   - **Purpose**: Contains configuration files, such as the database connection (`db.js`).
   - **Involvement**: Sets up connections to external services like MongoDB.

2. **`server/controllers`**
   - **Purpose**: Manages the logic for handling incoming requests and sending responses.
   - **Involvement**: Defines actions like user registration, login, or fetching data.

   - Example: `userController.js` contains functions for user-related operations (e.g., creating accounts).

3. **`server/middleware`**
   - **Purpose**: Contains reusable middlewares to process requests before they reach the controllers.
   - **Involvement**:
     - `authMiddleware.js`: Verifies user authentication.
     - `errorHandler.js`: Handles and formats errors.

4. **`server/models`**
   - **Purpose**: Defines database schemas and models (e.g., `User.js` for user data).
   - **Involvement**: Interacts with the database (e.g., MongoDB).

5. **`server/routes`**
   - **Purpose**: Organizes API routes (e.g., `/api/users`).
   - **Involvement**: Maps HTTP requests to controller actions.

6. **`server/services`**
   - **Purpose**: Contains reusable service logic, like sending emails or external API calls.
   - **Involvement**: Implements additional business logic.

7. **`server/tests`**
   - **Purpose**: Houses test files for automated testing.
   - **Involvement**: Ensures your backend code is reliable and bug-free.

8. **`server/utils`**
   - **Purpose**: Helper functions used across the backend.
   - **Involvement**: Includes utilities like token generation or file handling.

9. **Core Files**
   - **`index.js`**: The entry point of the server, initializes Express, connects to the database, and starts the app.
   - **`package.json`**: Defines dependencies and scripts for the backend.
   - **`package-lock.json`**: Ensures consistent package versions.

### **Common Folders: `node_modules`**
These folders contain all the installed dependencies for your frontend and backend, managed by `npm` or `yarn`. They are automatically generated when you run `npm install`.

---

### **How It All Fits Together**
1. **Frontend**:
   - Users interact with the **React** app in the `client/src` folder.
   - The app sends requests to the backend for data (e.g., user info).

2. **Backend**:
   - The **Node.js/Express** server in the `server` folder handles requests, processes data, and interacts with the database.

3. **Shared Configurations**:
   - Environment variables (`.env`) and code formatting tools ensure consistency.

4. **Collaboration**:
   - Documentation (`README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`) and `.gitignore` streamline team workflows.
